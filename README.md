# wysibot
For the WYSI game, pro osu gamers only!

ToDo for setup
1. Create a .env file
2. Add ADMIN, SERVERID, APIKEY (See example below)
```
ADMIN='["adminusername","admin2"]'
SERVERID=22222222222222222 #(Right-click on server -> Copy server ID)
APIKEY=111111111111111111111111 #(Discord apikey)
```
3. Ensure wysibot.py, .env, and player_score.json are in the same folder (player_score.json is created on first run)
4. Don't mess with the player_score.json file
